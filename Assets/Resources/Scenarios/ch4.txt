Wang Ergong: "Huh? Why does it take so long to get a cup?"

The president asked suspiciously.

Li Zhunei: "Sorry, the light is dark there."

I pushed my sunglasses. The president reluctantly accepted this excuse.

I put the cup on the table and slowly poured out the milk tea.

I poured slowly on purpose.

But there is always a time when the cup is full.

Gao Tian looked very happy, and I gave her a stiff smile back.

At this time, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Asano's face change.

what happened?

Sun Xiben: "I want to drink too."

Nishimoto stood beside me at some point and took a cup from my arms.

The ribbons in her hair brushed the wings of my nose as she bent down.

Chen Gaotian: "...Student Nishimoto..."

Gao Tian showed a bewildered expression, looking like an injured deer.

<|

Nishimoto's hand paused, but she pretended not to see it, and still poured the milk tea into the cup.

<|
show(ergong, 'normal', pos_l)

Nishimoto kept out of contact with others in this high school, and her abnormality aroused the vigilance of the president.

The president must have missed my stiff expression. She was looking back and forth between me, Nishimoto and Koten.

Asano wanted to say something, but was seized by the president.

Wang Ergong: "It doesn't matter, milk tea is enough."

Wang Ergong: "Maybe Nishimoto is also a little thirsty."

Zhang Qianye: "But, but... Takeuchi and Gaotian are not..."

Wang Ergong: "Everyone is a friend, what does it matter?"

As the president spoke, he randomly scrambled the cups on the table.

The three disposable cups are filled with milky white milk tea, and I can no longer tell the difference between you and me.

Asano glanced secretly at the empty glass bottle I threw into the garbage, showing a desperate expression.

Wang Ergong: "Takeuchi-kun, why don't you invite me first. Let's drink together. Gao Tian and Nishimoto have no opinion, right?"

Gao Tian not only had an opinion, her tears were about to pour out.

But she was too anxious to express what she meant.

Nishimoto stood still, as if he had lost his soul.

Time seems to freeze at this moment.

The raindrops outside also seemed to be stagnant in the air.

I took off my sunglasses with trembling handsâ€”

In an instant, the world turned grey.

It's a rare disease that can take away the joy of life.

A world without color would be hopeless.

People with this disease commit suicide twice as often as dying from the disease.

<|
anim:vfx(cam, {'colorless', 2}, {0, 1})

But on the contrary, some originally colorless and transparent substances will show wonderful colors.

It is not a color that normal people can understand, just like a person who is born blind cannot understand darkness.

<|

I drank that cup of milk tea in one gulp - I've seen this color once in the toilet.

Then, I put down the cup.

All the things around me, all the sounds in my ears can no longer restrain me.

Freed, I was too weak to move.

I tried my best to look out the window.

The scenery outside the window was gray and white, like an old photo.

I stared at the endlessly falling raindrops.

<|
anim:wait_all(anim_persist)

In my eyes, what should have been colorless raindrops also shone with the brilliance of the rainbow.
