I watched the falling rain in the hallway and calmed my mind.

It's a habit I picked up when I was a kid playing with childhood sweethearts.

Looking back, that time was probably the happiest day of my life.

I looked at the corridor, and sure enough, Sun Xiben was there.

Through my sunglasses, I watched her hair gradually become messy in the wind.

She looked out the window and had absolutely no intention of talking to me.

But I really want to talk to her.

Li Zhunei: "You came out too?"

Nishimoto didn't answer me.

anim:move(cam, {1, 1, 4})

I walked over to her and repeated what I just said.

Nishimoto turned his head and gave me a sideways glance, then turned away in disgust.

Sun Xiben: "What? Are you happy if I have to see that girl feed you milk tea one by one?"

Li Zhunei: "You know, Gao Tian is not that kind of person."

Sun Xiben: "Yeah, she's not that kind of person."

Nishimoto still had her back to me, and I felt like she was about to cry.

Sun Xiben: "It would be nice if she was worse."

I am speechless.

Sun Xiben: "Since you have disappeared for so many years, why are you still wearing those stupid sunglasses?"

Sun Xiben: "Do you think I won't recognize you if you wear it every day, transfer student?"

Nishimoto loved to cry when she was a child, but when she grew up, she stopped showing her emotions to the outside world.

This may have something to do with me, so I can't let Nishimoto get involved in this matter.

Li Zhunei: "The corridor is very cold, it's time to go back."

Nishimoto glared at me holding his shoulders.

Her frail body shivered in her uniform.

Sun Xiben: "Is this what you want to say to me?"

I stared at Nishimoto silently.

anim:move(cam, {3, 1.5, 3})

This is the first time since I entered the student council that I mustered up the courage to look at her carefully.

Compared with his childhood, Nishimoto has grown taller, and his face has faded from childishness.

But she still has the ribbon around her head that I gave her in the past.

I looked at the ribbon for a long time, then opened my mouth.

Li Takeuchi: "Yes, classmate Nishimoto."

Sun Xiben: "You bastard!"

Being slapped in the face, I could only stare blankly at Nishimoto running away.

I still hold the glass vial firmly in the palm of my hand.
