President Ninomiya rarely frowned her delicate brows.

The autumn rain seemed to put her in a bad mood.

Everyone sat in the student council room and chose to remain silent.

All I could hear was the dull and repetitive sound of the rain.

Asano-senpai leaned back in the chair and shrugged as if bored.

This is his peculiar habit.

He was a thin young man with white hair who served as secretary in the student council.

The teachers and janitors will not come today, maybe there are only a few student council officers left in the whole school.

Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh.

Sun Xiben: "Did anyone bring an umbrella?"

Nishimoto-san curled the ends of his hair with his fingers, and his tone was not very good.

Sun Xiben was my classmate, but he refused to talk to me outside the student union.

Like a willful cat, Nishimoto, with his eyes slightly raised, is cold to everyone.

But if she smiles more, she must be able to fascinate many boys.

<|

I really feel that way.

Nishimoto became the student council officer because of his outstanding grades, which is why I can sit here.

Chen Gaotian: "Everyone is in a hurry!"

Gao Tian swayed her smooth black hair.

Chen Gaotian: "We were suddenly notified that we were coming, and I didn't even explain the reason. I forgot to drink the milk tea I bought in the morning."

Zhang Qianye: "It turned out to be delayed because of the rainstorm. It's not my fault."

Wang Ergong: "You should confirm the situation before telling me!"

Zhang Qianye: "Then you can also confirm before contacting the student union officials."

As usual, President Ninomiya and Asano-senpai quarreled.

I heard that they all participated in the election of the student council president before I enrolled, and of course President Ninomiya was elected.

Asano-senpai had no choice but to settle for the next best thing and became a secretary.

Because of this, the two do not deal with each other very well, and sometimes quarrel.

But watching them quarrel all the time, others may think they have a good relationship.

I stared blankly at the interaction between the two.

This is part of the daily life of the Student Union.

At this time, Gao Tian took out a packaging bottle commonly found in convenience stores from the side of his schoolbag.

She gave me an apologetic smile and pushed the milk tea in front of me.

I looked at her silently.

Gao Tian's slender fingers look like works of art made of ivory against the fluorescent lights of the classroom.

Chen Gaotian: "Well, I didn't pay attention when I bought it. This milk tea has a little more weight."

Chen Gaotian: "Takeuchi-kun, if you don't mind... why don't we drink together?"

Chen Gaotian was my classmate.

We started dating a month ago.

Gao Tian was born into a single-parent family and never met his father.

Therefore, Gao Tian is very sensitive and needs more care than ordinary people.

Although we dated for a while, she just held my hand cautiously.

We never made further intimacy moves.

Even so, she seems to have felt very happy.

Perhaps her mood was affected by Qiu Yu, so she made such a request.

<|

Everyone in the student council looked at me, and they all knew a thing or two about Gao Tian's past.

I can't refuse.

<|

Li Zhunei: "Okay."

Chen Gaotian: "I thought Takeuchi-kun would find it annoying."

Gao Tian showed a pitiful smile and patted his chest lightly.

Li Zhunei: "No."

Chen Gaotian: "Takeuchi-kun has been talking very little, and wearing cool sunglasses, I thought it was difficult to approach at first."

Chen Gaotian: "Ah, I'm not saying that Takeuchi-kun is not good. His academic performance is very good, and the work of the student union is also very good."

Chen Gaotian: "Especially very gentle, really gentle."

Chen Gaotian: "I'm also very considerate to a stupid girl like me..."

<|
show(gaotian, 'cry')
|>
Chen Gaotian: "Sure enough, Takeuchi-kun accepted my confession just because he sympathized with me."

As Gao Tian spoke, the corners of his eyes were slightly moist.

Gao Tian is also a very crying girl.

<|

My body is stiff. Because I noticed that Nishimoto and the president were staring at me with sharp eyes.

Fortunately, Asano changed the subject at this time.

<|
show(qianye, 'normal', pos_c)

Zhang Qianye: "Ah, yes, there are disposable cups in the storage room. If the milk tea is cold... it's better to drink it slowly."

Asano said that while shaking his pinky finger at me.

<|
hide(qianye)
|>
I get it.

Li Zhunei: "I'll go get a cup."

I turned and left the student council room.
