Tutorial 3 Sound

<|
play(bgm, 'final')
|>
The `play` function is used to play background music

Select `Audios/BGM` in the Hierarchy window of the Unity Editor, and you can see the status of the background music in the Inspector window

<|
play(bgm, 'final', 1)
|>
The third parameter of `play` is the volume, the range is 0..1, the default is 0.5

<|
volume(bgm, 0.5)
|>
The volume can also be changed with the `volume` function

<|
play(bgm, 'final', 0.1)
play(bgs, 'rain', 1)
|>
Can play multiple music at the same time, each music is controlled by a game object

`bgs` is generally used to play background sound effects, it will loop like background music, but the file location (`AudioController.audioFolder`) and volume settings (`AudioVolumeController.configKeyName`) are the same as the sound effects

<|
stop(bgm)
stop(bgs)
|>
The `stop` function is used to stop the background music

BTW:: The title screen already has background music, so these tutorials have `stop(bgm)` at the beginning

<|
show(xiben, 'normal', pos_c)
sound('clap')
|>
The `sound` function is used to play sound effects

<|
sound('clap', 0.5)
|>
The second parameter of `sound` is the volume, which defaults to 1 (unlike the volume default of `play`)

<|
say(xiben, '08')
|>
The `say` function is used to play the speech

By the way: Colorless's script uses automatic speech, which will be discussed later

<|
hide(xiben)
|>
Nishimoto-san came out and scolded you, then went back

This concludes Tutorial 3 Sound
