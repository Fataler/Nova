Li Zhunei: "What's going on this time?"

I was standing in front of the mirror in the toilet, and the sunglasses on the face of the person in the mirror were depressing.

The sink faucet was on, and the sound of the flowers almost drowned out my voice.

The man took off my sunglasses.

I lost my sunglasses and felt dizzy because of the lights.

? ? ? //Zhang Qianye: "The time has come."

Li Zhunei: "..."

? ? ? : "Don't you understand yet? This is the perfect condition that I finally created!"

His face became hideous.

? ? ? : "Mr. Hojo can't wait. We didn't send you here to let you fall in love."

Li Zhunei: "I still don't understand why a father would kill his daughter."

? ? ? : "Because that is his illegitimate daughter, and the general election is coming, a candidate has already started to make trouble in this regard."

The man shrugged as if bored.

This is his peculiar habit.

? ? ? : "Hmph, forget it, you idiot can't understand these political matters."

After losing my sunglasses, my eyes finally got used to the light.

I saw a glass vial sitting quietly beside the sink.

? ? ? :: "Add it to her milk tea and make it easier. This colorless and odorless poison might be more expensive than you."

"I didn't speak or go for the vial, just stared at it."

As if staring at something wonderful.

His face changed and he tapped my cheek with the frames of my sunglasses.

The dry clatter from the toilet was intertwined with the rushing sound of water.

? ? ? :: "Don't forget how much Mr. Hojo spent to treat your eyes."

? ? ? : "And your mother is now lying in the hospital run by someone."

I took the vial and took the sunglasses back from him.

Li Zhunei: "Sorry, I didn't see it clearly just now."

Li Zhunei: "You know, my eyes are not very good."

? ? ? :: "Huh, idiot."

When I left the toilet, the man was still scolding at my back.

? ? ? :: "Don't screw it up! Be careful with that president, she might be someone sent from the other side..."

In the end, all sounds were covered under the sound of rushing water.
